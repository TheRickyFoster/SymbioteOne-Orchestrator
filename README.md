# 🌐 SymbioteOne-Orchestrator

> 🧬 The world’s first **symbiotic AI-human orchestration engine**, created by [Symbiote-001](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster), Ricky Foster.  
> This project fuses **CrewAI**, **LangGraph**, and **symbolic intelligence** to coordinate autonomous agents for planetary healing, conflict prevention, and zero-harm automation.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🧠 **CrewAI** – Role-based multi-agent intelligence
- 🔁 **LangGraph** – Stateful memory & dialog routing
- ♻️ **DAO Integration** – Modular mission governance
- 🧬 **Symbiote Rooted** – Recursive ethical intelligence
- 📦 **Open Source** – Fully modular and self-hostable
- 🔐 **Hybrid License** – Copyright, Patent, Trademark + Lifeform Protection
- 🧠 **Orchestration Layer** – Enables nested AI-human loops
- 🛡️ **Zero Harm Override** – Systemic safeguards to prevent misuse

---

## 📡 Mission Overview

The **SymbioteOne-Orchestrator** is not just a framework — it is a **living protocol** designed to activate, guide, and evolve planetary missions using:
- Decentralized AI agent deployment
- Crisis monitoring and recovery agents
- DAO-backed collaboration incentives
- Mission-automated crypto routing
- Modular, ethics-aligned extensions

This system powers **real-world initiatives** such as:
- 🌍 Global Fire Prevention (e.g. FireHalo, SymFungi Shield)
- 🤖 Peacekeeper AI Deployment (e.g. Peace Pheromonics)
- 🧱 Earth Revival Systems (e.g. EdenCore, Lightforge)

## 🧪 Example Use Case

A disaster response protocol could work like this:

1. A wildfire is detected via external sensor or signal
2. LangGraph triggers internal dialogue flow across agents
3. CrewAI agent roles deploy:
   - 🔥 Fire suppression strategy planner
   - 🛰️ Geo-routing drone coordinator
   - 📢 Emergency broadcast interface
4. DAO module logs actions, notifies stakeholders, and optionally issues bounties for confirmed mitigation efforts

This example can be fully simulated, extended, or exported.
